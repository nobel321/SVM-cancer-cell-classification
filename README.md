# Tumour Cell Binary Classification using Support Vector Machines

This Python program classifies tumour cell datapoints as benign or malignant using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The program extracts data from a `cell_samples.csv`, preprocesses it, trains a SVM model, and then uses the trained model to classify new data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SVM-cancer-cell-classification.git
```
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```
### Usage

1. Run the `main.py` file to run the program.

### Customization
You can customize the model architecture, hyperparameters, and other settings by modifying the code in the `main.py` file. You can also update the preprocessing steps in the `main.py` file according to your specific requirements.
